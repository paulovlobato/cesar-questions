# Question 6
Since question 6 requires a Email Service to be created, two applications were developed: an e-mail service listener, and an e-mail service sender.

The first application (called simply: question 6) requires a couple of changes.

On Android Studio, go to: 

```Run > Edit Configurations > Launch Options > Launch```

In the dropdown menu, select: ```Nothing```

Otherwide Android Studio will demand a MainActivity in order for the app to run.

With the service running, you can, then, start the "Questao 6 Sender" and start sending request to the previous running "Questao 6" Service Listener
